NoSQL implies not only SQL - a term used to describe a category of database systems
that do not follow the traditional relational database models (tables with rows and
columns).

Schema-less: Data can be stored without a fixed schema (structure can change over time).

Horizontal scaling: Easily distributed across many servers.

High performance: Optimized for fast read/write operations.

Flexible data models: Support various data types (documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.)
